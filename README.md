# BiLSTM
Simple Implementation of BiLSTM on DBpedia data

# Requirements
Python 3.6 , 
Keras 2.1.5

# Data
Download data from https://drive.google.com/open?id=1QUqmuPLX4c0Tk4IPbs91xk0uOLO_ap7r

N.B. If you downloaded the dataset from dbpedia then rename the 'train.csv' file to 'train_data.csv' and rename the 'test.csv' file to 'test_data.csv' before running the program. If you downloaded from Google drive then no need to rename and file. just run bi_lstm.py file
on your editor.
